# Yelp Recomendation System
This is the last project while at Flatiron School Data Science Immersive Program (on campus) in New York City. Other projects can be found at the main GitHub repo.

-- Project Status: Completed

# Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a Yelp Recommendation system by using Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering models to get business recommendations for users. The model makes predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or information from many users (collaborating). The assumption is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue.

# Project Description
The data is an open dataset that Yelp provides annually for use in personal, educational, and academic purposes. The original dataset contains 209,393 businesses, 1,968,703 users and 8,021,122 reviews across 10 metropolitan areas.
