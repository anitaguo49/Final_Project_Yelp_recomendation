# Yelp Recomendation System
This is the last project while at Flatiron School Data Science Immersive Program (on campus) in New York City. Other projects can be found at the main GitHub repo.

-- Project Status: [Completed]

# Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a Yelp Recommendation system by using Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering models to get business recommendations for users. The model makes predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or information from many users (collaborating). The assumption is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue.

writeup/reporting
etc. (be as specific as possible)

# Getting Started
Clone this repo (for help see this tutorial).

Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)

Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)

etc...

If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here
