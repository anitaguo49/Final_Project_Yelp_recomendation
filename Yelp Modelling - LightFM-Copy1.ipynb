       " 'today was my second out of three sessions i had paid for. although my first session went well, i could tell meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. however, i returned because she did my teeth fine and i was pleased with the results. when i went in today, i was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. my appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, i always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. unbothered by those signs, i waited my turn. she checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if i was ok. she attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if i had any irritation. half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. while she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. so, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. while i sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. when my light turned off, i released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming i was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. at this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. i began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. i was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room i was already out of my chair. she finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin e on my gum burn (pictured below). at this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and i was so irritated that i had to suffer, all i wanted was to leave. while i waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" while i totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so i could let her know. not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn\\'t even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but i had the light off for a solid two minutes before i couldn\\'t stand the pain. she admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because i wanted to leave after the way i was treated. i also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact i won\\'t be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. she was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and i were down the steps. i have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman\\'s behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" admit your wrongs, but don\\'t make your guest feel unwelcome because you can\\'t do you job properly.',\n",

       " 'i love chinese food and i love mexican food. what can go wrong? a couple of things. first things first, this place is more of a \"rice bowl\" kind of place. i thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. the ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and i got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). i also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.\\n\\ni\\'m gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. i don\\'t think arizona uses those health department letter grade system like california does, but if i were to just judge by how it looked inside, i\\'d give it a \"c\" grade lol. we waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. we took it to go and ate at our hotel room. \\n\\nmmmm... the food was just alright. the jade chicken was nothing special. it tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. the hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. if you aren\\'t sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. \\n\\nthe jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. a friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of mcdonald\\'s apple pie. if you order the burrito, be warned that it\\'s a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. \\n\\nthey provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. \\n\\nnot gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. i used the bathroom like 5 times. i don\\'t recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day.',\n",

(which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for valentine\\'s day you probably shouldn\\'t answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how \"hot\" her female coworker is.)  this was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren\\'t eavesdropping on personal info. most uncomfortable \"romantic\" evening of my life...\\n\\nnow to the food.  the valentine\\'s day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a \"salad\", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the new zealand rack of lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a chocolate creme brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of nero d\\'avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). we ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.\\n\\n\\nthe soup - lobster bisque (delicious) and minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. it was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). however it did taste quite nice.\\n\\nthe appetizer - artichokes with prosciutto.. yummo!\\n\\nthe salad - hmm not what i had in mind. a tiny plate of feta cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but not a traditional salad..so beware!  taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...this it is not.\\n\\nthe meal - veal with shrimp and gnocchi..quite pleasing to the palette.\\n\\nthe dessert - chocolate creme brulet...   umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of chocolate mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  yes it did taste good, however...where was the creme brulet the waiter raved about?\\n\\nthe wine - nero d\\'avola...yes i am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  but upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...why the lie? we would have ordered the special anyway...\\n\\nthe atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and christmas lights through out. they had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. the place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. the manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  by the time i left, my toes were frozen.\\n\\nwe finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. i turned around and noticed four empty 2 person tables. they had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple! \\n\\nupon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.\\n\\nwould i go back when in town again? no.  at the risk of being sat in that situation again.  the food can be the most delicious in the world, but i still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.\\n\\nand to the lady we sat next to...good luck on your birth, maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth.',\n",

       " 'my husband and i used to order from here more than i\\'d like to admit (almost weekly). the pizza is pretty mediocre, but it\\'s really cheap and convenient. the cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. we always order online (which i love), it\\'s right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we\\'re that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. \\n\\nlast time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. we ordered cheesy bread, a philly sub, and onion rings. i asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.\\n\\ni paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). my husband showed up about 20 minutes after i ordered. not only wasn\\'t the food ready, but apparently they hadn\\'t even started it and were in no hurry. he waited almost another hour (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it\\'s about a one minute drive) to get our food. they didn\\'t comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. \\n\\nwhen we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. i\\'d waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. i hopped in the car because, as i said, it\\'s literally around the corner, and junk food just ain\\'t the same without ranch for dippin. \\n\\ni walked in. everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but i was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"i\\'ll be right with you.\" finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. i told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could i just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. now that may have been an excessive amount, but i had low blood sugar brain. and at this point i figured they\\'d throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they\\'d screwed up!). instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. why? i have no idea. but she said she was new, so i said fine. she went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who i assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can i help you, i was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who i was and what i ordered. he also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. it was like they all had amnesia! you don\\'t remember the tall skinny dude who just left after waiting for his order for an hour?! he told me what i ordered like i was on crack and what was the problem. i said yes, i know what i ordered, but i requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. again, he rudely asked me how many i wanted, incredulous i was asking. it was like the freakin inquisition. do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn\\'t get ranch with their orders?? he started taking containers out of the fridge. i was so upset by this point that i don\\'t even know what he said that prompted me say \"wow, you are really something else.\" there were four containers of ranch on the counter which i snatched while i could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they\\'re 75 cents a piece. i may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. \\n\\ni honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service i have ever received. it certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. i can\\'t believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. i worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.\\n\\ni realize no one cares or will ever read this. my husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but i was just so incredulous about the entire thing. it was cathartic. i feel better. though that will be of little comfort next time i want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.',\n",

this is the kind of employee you need more of!\\n\\nnow the bad: 7700 s autoplex\\n\\ni first went to this location because i needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. i got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. i also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. i let that all slide, as just being an off day.\\n\\ni then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. i also let that slide.\\n\\ni then went to get a wash yesterday. not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before i came! to begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. there was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. the only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. there were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.\\n\\nwhen i pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. i was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. the manager, who i do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. i remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because i knew they caused the problem. at this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. they were disrespectful and discourteous.\\n\\nfinally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. they asked me to come back the next day. obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.\\n\\ni went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.\\n\\nthe next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, i discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. \\n\\ni knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. also these were obviously clean panties, so i gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.\\n\\ni suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact i was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality tv.\\n\\nas a result i was livid. i had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.\\n\\ni went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. they clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. \\n\\nthey reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. at this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when i brought the car in. i was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.\\n\\njared to the rescue:\\n\\ni took the car directly to the 616 location and saw jared busily working with his staff. i pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. after being checked in i called out to jared and explained the situation to him. he dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  this was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.\\n\\nlesson: never go to the 7700 location!

       " \"4.5 stars\\n\\nan extra star for the legendary iraqi fish dish known as 'masgoof.'  if you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in iraq.  an entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is tilapia - which is quite good and i suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  the result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  it is not very often that i get the pleasure of enjoying a nice masgoof.\\n\\nin most cases, i find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because i don't love the almighty kabob, it's because i have come to expect that kabob places outside of the middle east, detroit, and even western europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - i should have never made that trip to iran in 2007 where i was in kabob paradise.  however, chateau kabob located in the frankophilic metropolis of montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  here in washington, dc we need to cling to places like shamshiri and alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  chateau kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in iraq and iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of kabobs.  at chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent kabob.  and perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that chateau also got right is the rice!  it is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.\\n\\nthe interiors and décor of chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as i've come to expect that most other persian or arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  it appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually design the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  some aspiring middle eastern restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  i'm glad the guys at chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.\\n\\nhats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you'll meet.\",\n",

( cannot use regular green... yellow ford required ) then i say i will come get it when they fix the ac, they tell me hours later its the pcm..( computer ) well ok you guys shorted it out, the only thing wrong was a valve rattle, now this?? after 2 days with lkq saying they are going to send a inspector i drove past and noticed my mirrors loose (broken ) on both sides!! i am anal when it comes to my car i bought new in 2007..  this was enough, i took it home.. i had enough...  they forgot 4 bolts, 2 in wrong spot, one digging into power steering rack, power steering bottle cracked on bottom from a poor removal and hid the fact it was cracked on the lower nipple and the ac system they claimed did not hold r-134a because they did remove the ac later and lost the o-rings when they filled it, it leaked.. and they shorted the ac protective diode.. it was not the pcm.. this place might be good for a oil change if you tell them how to do it, but that's all..  telling me how do we know you didn't bring it in here like this... bahahaha, a back yard weekend mechanic was able to figure out they were unskilled for the task.. i will make sure with a huge online review on every review site that this place is not the place to take a car... or a peddle bike for that matter..\\n\\ni replaced the o-rings, pulled the diode and got the ac working after i vacuumed it and refilled, what armatures..  i guess i got to go to ford, spend $80 on a new power steering bottle and tell lkq to send me the money..\\n\\nwhen they first got my car knowing it was under warranty from lkq they tried to get me to pay them the other $45 per hour on top of the $55 an hour they were getting under warranty... i told them do not touch it until i contact lkq, they tried to scam me out of $45 an hour x12 hours.... i am not stupid..  lkq should have pulled it out right there and then, but no.. they agreed to do it for the $55 an hour, but the skill these guys have isn't worth minimum wage..\",\n",

       " \"i had two different experiences with carpet monkey. in both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when i needed to. also, they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. this is a great help since i had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. their price was also quite good since i requested 4 rooms upstairs, hallway, stairs, and downstairs bedroom. now the first experience i had was on 09/15. the person who came to clean was mark. i was not satisfied at all with his work. he didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. the stairs looked worse than before he came. there were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. in a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since i chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. the work i had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. however instead of rushing to yelp i figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20. this is where i can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. when i called i believe the owner picked up. if i remember correctly his name was rick. i told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that i wasn't satisfied at all with mark's work. he said he'll send his right hand man joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22. again communication is very easy with this company. on top of that rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. so saturday comes and we get a phone call from isaac saying he's on his way, again great communication. i didn't worry too much that it wasn't joe at our door like i was told since isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. he let me show him where i wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. i was surprised since i thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. but he went over everything all over again and everything looked a lot better. the stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and isaac also went ahead and did the risers which i wasn't expecting. there were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after isaac went over them. he also put the corner protectors on the wall which i appreciated (something mark didn't do). so my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. this alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. second experience with isaac was way better and communication with the company is a breeze. thank you isaac and rick!\",\n",

       " \"brfc is a solid place to try some really good chicken. i've been very happy on my recent visits to brfc. our chicken combos were tender, juicy, crispy, and flavorful. we like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. my husband and i really enjoy it and plan on returning. \\n\\npros: \\n\\n* friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter \\n* clean and modern decor with plenty of seating/table options and large windows\\n* large tvs (we watched football during one of our visits) \\n* combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw\\n   fries: skinny, crispy, salty, and plentiful | coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste\\n* their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning. \\n  their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun) \\n  we do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming \\n* their boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable\\n* their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable\\n* milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken\\n* honey dipping sauce options: wildflower, chipotle and wasabi honey flavors \\n  i love all their honey options for my chicken tenders \\n* other dipping sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own brbbq barbecue dip\\n* lunch box special deal:  m-f |  11am - 4pm  | 3 whole wings, fries, and a drink = 8 bucks \\n\\ncons: \\n\\n* it seems a bit pricey for what it is. essentially, it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. you're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. however, i do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. it's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.  \\n\\nreview 1 for 2017\",\n",

       " 'this was my first visit to top golf, and i brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  the overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is really fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  why two stars, you ask?\\n\\nthere are major issues with this place that test your patience.  first off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on friday).  there are two line queue\\'s but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  as it turns out, the first line is the \"membership line\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  \\n\\nthe second line, is to \"check in\" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  \\n\\nboth of those tasks sound so easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  the entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  after all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  \\n\\nafter all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  \\n\\nthen, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here i guess.  \\n\\nwe head to our bay with a \"bay concierge\" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  \\n\\nwe start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  he literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn\\'t know what a \"slider\" was.  (mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  we order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his grandma in colorado, and what it was like working after christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.\\n\\nwhen the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\"  the server leaned in all interested.... \"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\".  our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  he stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \"could we have napkins?\" - and there was this \\'oh yeah\\' moment - he was oblivious at times.\\n\\nso, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  the refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  we came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.\\n\\nthe kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  he told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  he asked us if we wouldn\\'t mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  \\n\\nok, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to improve and figure out where you are failing.  the fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are all issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  if i owned this place, i would be pissed off.   \\n\\nagain, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.',\n",

       " \"i remember coming to the buffet at the bellagio several years ago for sunday champagne brunch and being blown away.   it was one of the best brunches i had ever eaten.  alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  i brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet i remembered.  \\n\\nwell, we got off to a bad start.  my son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and i carried him into the restaurant.  at the register, i discovered that there was no children's price and that i would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  because it was mom's birthday, i went with it, but i was annoyed.  no child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. they want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so i paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  my bad.\\n\\nas for the adult meals, the food was fine.  i had prime rib, which was only ok, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  my mother had the crab legs which she loved.  we must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  the waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  \\n\\nreally the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but i just can't help but feel like we over paid.  there was nothing remarkable offered.  the service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  well, dessert was pretty great, but i don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.  i'm just not feeling the love for this place this time.\",\n",

       " \"awful awful people! i'm only giving them one star because i can't post otherwise, but they're not even worth that. i used movingapt.com to find them - won't ever use them again either. i thought having an agent would prevent this kind of crap from happening. i don't even know where to start with my complaints; this entire move was a mess from the beginning due to lack of communications and professionalism. i paid extra for a specific move date and time, as well as a 'special handling fee' because of my piano. \\n\\nwhen they arrive for the pick-up - 2 days late 6 hours after they were supposed to be there - they didn't come prepared for a piano. my dad and uncle had to find 2x4's to use as a ramp and help the movers hold it and roll it off the porch. this is a stage piano, the wheels aren't really meant for rolling around cement! after loading everything and telling my parents they were headed my way (virginia), my stuff is taken from wyoming to seattle, then back to vegas where it was put in storage without my knowledge or permission. i only found out because i kept calling to see the whereabouts of the truck so i could plan accordingly. after repeated phone calls, and finally the threat of legal action, my items were put back on a truck and started the journey east. \\n\\nfinally, they call to tell me they'll be there on june xx, which is exactly during the 3-day window i said i would be out of the state and not be able to receive the truck - again, all covered before the contract was even signed. so i'm told if i can't get a friend to meet them at my house and let them in, they'd go on to new york with my stuff and i'd have to pay an additional fee to get it, whenever they brought it back to me, which would be at their discretion. luckily, i was able to get a hold of someone and coordinate with them to receive the shipment, upon which he started taking pictures the moment the truck was opened. (see below). after they had unloaded everything and after i had confirmed 3 times over the course of this month that they had the proper equipment, they realize that in fact, they don't have anything to move the piano. so they decide they'll go to home depot, hire random men, and carry/lift the piano into my house. you don't lift a piano! so my friend that's there says no, it's too heavy, you need the proper equipment, i suggest you go find it. so then they tell him that they need to get on the road to new york for their next job so they'll just go put my piano in a warehouse until i was back so i'd let them deliver it. again, they're told no, at which point the driver calls me while i'm in the airport and says if i don't let them into my house i'd have to pay a second delivery fee. i told them not to leave the state with my piano and i'd call them right back - so i call my friend and ask what's going on; he gives me the scoop. i asked him if he'd run up the street - about 4 blocks from my house - and secure a storage unit that these guys could back the truck right up to the ramp, get the piano on a dolly and store it there for two days til i could get a professional. he said ok, and while i'm still on the phone, i hear him say exactly that to the driver. i call the driver back myself and say the same thing. i literally asked them to wait 15 minutes while we got this taken care of; he said ok. my friend leaves, gets the paperwork for a storage unit, comes back and these guys have unloaded the piano, rolled it down the sidewalk (no dolly), tried to lift it up my 4 steps, dropped it, eventually go it inside, and we're running to their truck when my friend gets back. they hadn't given him the inventory sheets or had him sign anything, so he hollers at them and runs after. he had to jump in his own vehicle to chase them down and cut them off before they stopped. at that point they gave him the paperwork - still not signed - and took off again. \\n\\nas soon as i got home that same evening i went right to the piano to take a look and started taking pictures. i called the driver and asked what had happened. he said nothing, everything was fine, no damage. i called bs and told him i'm standing in my living room looking at the damage. he hung up and i've never been able to get a hold of these people since.\",\n",

       " '7/15/17. came to vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and saturday just seemed to want us to be at encore beach club the entire day/night. first, we attended diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. we ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. the staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. the rave-booty was twerk-tacular. there were spankings. the bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. all i saw were smiles. you could see diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the dj. we danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. \\n\\nas more of my group came in from all over, we came back for marshmello saturday night (nightswim!), whom i hadn\\'t seen since edc last year. we got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we\\'d want a dry drinking spot haha. our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the vip even invited us into the small vip pool behind us. \\n\\nwe got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. i was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as i forgot to tell the bank i was leaving the state. my host alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while i called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. she was calm and pleasant, and simply said \"this happens all the time.\" (this was in stark contrast to the treatment at omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). \\n\\nalexia and her runner, damn i totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. she came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. they also made sure we stayed hydrated! super important when it\\'s 100 at night. they gave us just the right amount of attention and class. \\n\\nthank you guys, and special thanks to alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! truly i don\\'t expect anything less from encore/wynn (xs, surrender/encore beach club) - i never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that i have both attended with tickets and tables. they are the best, they will always be the best. \\n\\nthanks again! :-)',\n",

       " \"active renter manages all my property in phoenix/scottsdale.  i chose them over several other companies because they are honest, hard-working individuals who operate their business with integrity and professionalism.  they manage my property so well i never have to worry about the details.  and as an out-of-state property owner, i don't want to worry and have extra hassles!  they take care of everything, every step of the way.  their communications are clear, concise, timely, and professional.  i will never switch and go to another company because i am so convinced i am getting honest and impeccable service from active renter, at a very reasonable cost.\\n\\nas for the tenants who are complaining, i am hard-pressed to believe that rich and the entire active renter crew have treated anyone poorly or have not serviced rentals in a timely manner. there are also people who tear up property (not their property!!) and then complain when they get billed for all the damages.  these are probably the same tenants who punch holes in dry wall, steal furnaces (who does that!?!?!?!), damage landscaping, tear up concrete driveways, etc.  - and then later complain when they are held accountable for the damages they created.  it's said that people who have negative comments are much more likely to post a review than people with positive comments - on a 9 to 1 basis!  so for every complaint, remember there are dozens, hundreds, perhaps even thousands of individuals who have wonderfully positive things to say about active renter, but just don't take the time to post a review.\\n\\nfrom either the property management or the leasing side, i don't think you'll get better service anywhere than active renter provides.  i would recommend them - without reservation - to any family member, friend, and/or colleague.  they are the best in the business and their high rate of growth is proof positive they are the best property management company around.  you can't go wrong with active renter.  they are the real deal.\\n\\nif i could give them 10 stars, i would!  they are that awesome!\\n\\np. s.  and i just have to add that the individuals who are posting negative comments sound childish and immature in their reviews.  resorting to name-calling (snake with legs!?!?!?!?!) and foul language is a sure sign of someone throwing a tantrum when asked to be accountable for their actions.  look at their other reviews and you might see a pattern.\",\n",

(my preference) or a california burger. same meat, but this one comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a \"freddy\\'s sauce\" which is your typical thousand island, fry sauce, spread, etc. \\nthey also offer chicago style hot dogs, grilled chicken sandwiches, and desserts. \\nthe service is always, without a doubt, amazing. they train the employees well and it shows. good quality, good prices, and good people. \\ndo yourself a favor and skip wendy\\'s, mcdonald\\'s, and for sure pass by the taco bell next to this place, you won\\'t regret it.',\n",
